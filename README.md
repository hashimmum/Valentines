💖 Valentine's Invitation in Style 💖

This Valentine's, ask your girlfriend or wife to be your Valentine in a truly unique way! Follow the steps below to create a personalized, interactive invitation that playfully ensures she can only say "Yes"!

Step 1: 🎨 Customize with Her Favorite Color
Edit the CSS file to change the background color to her favorite. Look for the background-color property in the .body or #main selector and update it with her preferred color.
Step 2: ✍️ Personalize Names
In the index.html file, replace "girlfriend's name" with her actual name to make it feel truly meant for her.
In the script.js file, find where my name appears and replace it with yours. This way, she knows exactly who's asking!
Step 3: 💻 Preview and Deploy

Step 4: 💌 Share Your Personalized Valentine
Once you've customized the page, share the link with her. She'll be greeted with a page that's not only in her favorite color but also personally addresses her by name, with a playful twist: the "No" option elusively moves away, nudging her towards the "Yes" button!
🌹 Make this Valentine's Day unforgettable by combining technology with a touch of romance. 🌹

Your effort in personalizing this experience will surely make her smile and remember this gesture for years to come. Good luck, and may your Valentine's Day be as special and joyful as your love for each other! 💑
